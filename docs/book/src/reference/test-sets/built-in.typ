= Types
There are a few available types:

#table(
  columns: 2,
  table.header[Type][Explanation],
  table.hline(),

  [`function`], [Functions which evaluate to another type upon compilation.],
  [`test set`], [Represents a set of tests.],
  [`number`], [Positive whole numbers.],
  [`string`], [Used for patterns containing special characters.],
  [`pattern`], [Special syntax for test sets which operate on test identifiers.],
)

A test set expression must always evaluate to a test set, otherwise it is ill-formed, all operators operate on test sets only.
The following may be valid `set(1) & set("aaa", 2)`, but `set() & 1` is not.
There is no arithmetic, and at the time of writing this literals like numbers and strings are included for future test set functionality.

= Functions
The following functions are available, they can be written out in place of any expression.

#table(
  columns: 2,
  table.header[Name][Explanation],
  table.hline(),

  [`none()`], [Includes no tests.],
  [`all()`], [Includes all tests.],
  [`skip()`], [Includes tests with a skip annotation],
  [`unit()`], [Includes unit tests],
  [`template()`], [Includes template tests],
  [`compile-only()`], [Includes tests without references.],
  [`ephemeral()`], [Includes tests with ephemeral references.],
  [`persistent()`], [Includes tests with persistent references.],
)

= Patterns
Patterns are special types which are checked against identifiers and automatically turned into test sets.
A pattern starts with a pattern type before a colon `:` and is either followed by a raw pattern or a string literal.
Raw patterns don't have any delimiters and parse anything that's not whitespace, a literal comma `,` or literal parenthesis `(`/`)`.
String patterns are pattern prefixes directly followed by literal strings, they can be used to clearly denote the start and end of a pattern.
Because parenthesis `(`/`)` are not parsed as raw patterns, regex patterns require quoting if capture groups are used.

The following pattern types exist:

#table(
  columns: 3,
  table.header[Type][Example][Explanation],
  table.hline(),

  [`e`/`exact`], [`exact:mod/name`], [Matches by comparing the identifier exactly to the given term.],
  [`r`/`regex`], [`regex:mod-[234]/.*`], [Matches using the given regex.],
  [`g`/`glob`], [`g:foo/**/bar`], [Matches using the given glob pattern.],
)
